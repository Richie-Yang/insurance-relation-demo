# chat-app

Chat-app, the web service which provides realtime conversation service.

You can visit the dmeo website here:
https://chat-app-vlwbiireva-de.a.run.app/login

## Motivation

This app is built for testing websocket purpose only. I used to build other type of chat app with firestore and related listener kit, but this time I wanted to try websocket, and most time will mainly spent on backend side, so the frontend is not that fancy.

main components:

- Koa.js
- Websocket
- GCP Firestore
- GCP Cloud Run
